A open server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. UNWDelicatedSoftware is a fork of [pmmp](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) and [Foxel](https://github.com/FoxelTeam/Foxel)

## Multi Version:
Thank to Foxel, we have a multiversion for servers:

+ Support for 1.12
+ Support 1.13 (Testing)

## Plugins

Most of PMMP can used with UNWDelicatedSoftware, but few plugin is included Spoon, that will auto-disable load plugin after checked that the server image is 3rd build, not by PMMP.
You can use these plugin by add "yes" in the end of "/plugin_data/<PLUGIN_FOLDER>/spoon.txt" file

Some issue will be fixed at future version:
+ I dunno, it worked correctly in my server
+ If you want a bug report, translate report,etc please open issues in this repo :) Thank you
